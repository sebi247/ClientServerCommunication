# ClientServerCommunication

This overview explains how to implement client-server communication using sockets in Java. Sockets provide a way for two programs to communicate over a network, allowing them to exchange data.
Algorithm Overview
+	Create a server that listens for incoming connections on a specific port.
+	Create a client that connects to the server using the server's IP address and port.
+	Establish a connection between the server and client using sockets.
+	Exchange data between the server and client using input and output streams.
+	Close the connection and sockets when the communication is complete.
Server-Side Implementation
+	Create a ServerSocket that listens for incoming connections on a specific port.
+	Wait for a client to connect using the accept() method, which returns a Socket() for the established connection.
+	Obtain input and output streams from the socket to read and write data.
+	Process the received data and send a response to the client using the output stream.
+	Close the socket and input/output streams when the communication is finished.
Client-Side Implementation
+	Create a Socket to connect to the server using the server's IP address and port.
+	Obtain input and output streams from the socket to read and write data.
+	Send data to the server using the output stream.
+	Read the server's response using the input stream.
+	Close the socket and input/output streams when the communication is complete.
